The dataset reveals some interesting things about ride behavior. The timeframe of the data encapsulates 3 months (June 2019 to July 2019) and outliers and seemingly erroneous data (riders that were born >120 years ago) were removed from the dataset.

In terms of high level demographics, during this 3 month time period 6.5 total trips were taken. Broken down by gender, 65% of these rides were male, 25% were female, and the remainder did not have gender disclosed. This distribution stayed consistent for each of the 3 months.

The average trip duration was about 17.6 minutes, although in June this increased to 18.4 minutes.

The average distance covered (in terms of geographic mileage from start to endpoint) was 1.15 miles during the time period, however the median distance was about 0.7 miles.

When we look at how the distribution of trips varied by age group, there is also a bias towards riders in their 20's.



When we look at geography, particularly the most popular start and end points for riders on their journeys, it's interesting to note that the 10 most popular start and end points were the same stations. All these stations were located in lower to middle Manhattan along major routes (particularly the WestSide Highway and Broadway). 

Another interesting note about geography is that when we cross reference census data (2016 income) with the popularity of Bike stations (shown by the larger colored bike icons in the maps), none of the popular stations are in areas with a lower income bracket.
